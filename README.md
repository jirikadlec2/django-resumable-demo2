# django-resumable-demo2
Testing resumable.js and the django-resumable app.

This demo shows how to use https://github.com/leriomaggio/django-resumable for uploading big files (> 10 GB) to the server in small chunks.

Tests of uploader behavior in the event of page refresh, upload pausing and network interruption will also be carried out.
